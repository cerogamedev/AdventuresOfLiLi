The great warrior... Come and see what I've lost
I live away from people. I don't hurt anybody.
But look what those cursed witches did to me!
Please, if you see Greta, let her know what happened!


 * [I'm Greta's wife! I'll find her!]
 You're a woman of honour.
  * [Who??]
 What?
  * [Get away from here, it's dangerous!]
 Im okey to not okey!
 
 - Bon voyage, warrior! May the light of Greta be with you!
 - Follow the light! You can only find Greta in the light!
    -> END
